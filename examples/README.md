# Examples

This directory contains example programs that showcase how you can use the Litha library for machine learning and AI applications in Zig. The examples demonstrate the envisioned usage and the API of Litha.

Please note, these examples are not functional yet as they represent the (potential) future structure of the Litha library, which is currently under construction. They are here to give you a sense of the design principles and usability that Litha will offer once it is fully developed.

Also, they are pretty much a draft.

### 1. Simple XOR NN (`simple_xor_nn.zig`)

| A | B | A XOR B |
| - | - | ------- |
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 1       |
| 0 | 1 | 1       |
| 1 | 1 | 0       |

This is an example of a simple neural network trained to solve the XOR problem, a classic non-linear problem to test a neural network library. This file is designed to demonstrate the basic structure of neural networks in Litha, including the process of defining a network, training it, evaluating it and using it to make predictions.

As with all examples in this directory, please note that this is a draft and is not currently functional, as it represents potential future API and features of the Litha library. The example is provided to give you a sense of how you might use Litha in the future once it is fully developed.
