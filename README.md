# What is Litha?

> *Important!* This library is still under construction, so it might not be suitable for production use cases just yet. However, your contributions and feedback can help us expedite its readiness for broader usage.

Litha is a powerful library designed to cater to machine learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and deep learning operations in the Zig programming language.

## Why Zig?

Zig is an emerging language that is designed to be simple, reliable, and efficient, filling a unique niche in the programming world. Here's why we chose Zig for the Litha library:

### 1. Simplicity and Readability
Zig aims to be simple and straightforward. There are no hidden behaviors or complex abstractions. This means the code you write is the code that gets executed, leading to highly predictable and easy-to-debug programs.

### 2. Performance
Zig enables low-level programming without losing high-level convenience. It provides manual memory management and other low-level features, making it possible to write extremely efficient code.

### 3. Control
Zig offers robust control over system resources, allowing direct management of memory allocation and hardware. It also supports compiling to C, enabling interoperability with a vast number of existing libraries.

### 4. Safety
While Zig gives you a lot of power, it also encourages writing safe code. It has built-in features to handle errors explicitly and avoid undefined behavior.

### 5. Community
The Zig community is vibrant and growing. This provides a pool of shared knowledge and resources for developers working in Zig.

In summary, Zigâ€™s blend of simplicity, efficiency, control, safety, and community makes it a great fit for Litha. We believe that Zig's philosophy aligns with our goals to provide a simple, efficient, and powerful library for machine learning and AI.

## License

The primary mission of Litha, like the Zig project, is to serve users. This doesn't only mean the developers who use Litha to build machine learning and AI models, but more importantly, the end-users who benefit from the applications created using this library.

Our aim is for Litha to be a tool that empowers end-users, not to exploit them financially or restrict their freedom to interact with hardware or software in any way.

We firmly believe in fostering a culture of open-source collaboration and sharing. However, setting up social norms around these values tends to be a more effective way to ensure their adherence than complicating software licenses. As such, complicating the software license of Litha could potentially jeopardize the value it brings to its users.

Therefore, Litha is released under the MIT (Expat) License, coupled with a simple request: use it to improve how software caters to the needs of end-users.
